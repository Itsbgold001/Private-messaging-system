Private-messaging-system
========================

This is my own class for private messaging system, built using plain PHP. 

It's still under development. To find out more, visit the issues page.

The main core of this project is completed. 

You can implement this on your website without any problems and use it.

Get the number of unread messages - get_number_of_unread_messages()
